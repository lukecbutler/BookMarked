## 1. Patron and Membership Management

- **1.1**: As a librarian, I want to enroll a new patron and issue a library card so that the patron can check out items.  
- **1.2**: As a librarian, I want to renew an expired library card so that a patron can continue borrowing items.  
- **1.3**: As a librarian, I want to view a patron’s current fines and number of checked-out items during checkout so that I can enforce borrowing rules.

## 2. Checkout Process

- **2.1**: As a librarian, I want to scan an item and check it out to a patron so that I can process loans efficiently.  
- **2.2**: As a librarian, I want the system to automatically calculate the due date so that I no longer need to stamp it manually.  
- **2.3**: As a librarian, I want the system to deactivate theft protection on an item after successful checkout so that patrons can exit without triggering alarms.

## 3. Check-In Process

- **3.1**: As a librarian, I want to scan a returned item so that the system can log its return and update its status.  
- **3.2**: As a librarian, I want the system to automatically calculate fines for overdue items so that I don’t have to do it manually.  
- **3.3**: As a librarian, I want the system to handle damaged or unscannable items so that we can process them separately.

## 4. Inventory and Item Management

- **4.1**: As the head librarian, I want to add new item types (e.g., new media formats) so that the library collection can evolve.  
- **4.2**: As the head librarian, I want to add new copies of an existing item so that they are available for checkout.  
- **4.3**: As a branch librarian, I want to receive transferred copies from central and mark them as available so they can be shelved.

## 5. Fines and Overdue Management

- **5.1**: As a librarian, I want to view and manage patron fines so that I can collect overdue payments.  
- **5.2**: As a librarian, I want the system to block checkout for patrons with unpaid fines above a threshold so that we enforce policy.

## 6. Reporting and Administration *(Stretch Features)*

- **6.1**: As an administrator, I want to view reports on checkouts, returns, fines, and patron activity so that I can make operational decisions.  
- **6.2**: As a librarian, I want automated notifications to remind patrons of overdue items so that fines are minimized.
