1. Duplicate Patron ID Causes Crash

Description: When a user tries to add a Patron with an existing PatronID, the application crashes with an sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError instead of showing a friendly validation message.

Steps to Reproduce:

Run the application (python App.py).

Go to the "Add Patron" page.

Enter an existing PatronID (for example: 8596).

Click Submit.

Expected Result: The system should display a user-friendly message such as “Patron ID already exists. Please use a unique ID.”

Actual Result: Application crashes and displays a technical error traceback (IntegrityError).

Severity: Medium

Status: ❌ Open

Suggested Fix: Add input validation or a try-except block in the backend before inserting new patrons into the database.
